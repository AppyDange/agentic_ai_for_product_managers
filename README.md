# Agentic AI for Product Managers: My Toolkit

> This repository contains my personal frameworks, guides, and resources for Product Managers on how to effectively build, manage, and scale products using Agentic AI.

As a Product Manager / Founder / Technologist, I'm focused on bridging the gap between complex AI capabilities and real-world user value. This repo is where I document and share my methodologies for a new generation of AI-native products.


## 💡 My Product Philosophy for Agentic AI

I believe successful Agentic AI products are built on three pillars:

* **Precise Job-to-be-Done (JTBD):** Agents must be designed to accomplish a specific, high-value user goal, not just be a "wrapper" for an LLM.
* **Trust Through Reliability:** User adoption is 100% dependent on the agent's reliability. This means focusing on guardrails, validation, and clear error handling from day one.
* **Rapid, Data-Driven Iteration:** Building an agent is a process of discovery. My approach centers on launching a minimal viable agent (MVA), defining the right success KPIs, and iterating relentlessly.

## 🗓️ What's Coming Next

This repository is actively maintained. Here is a preview of topics I'll be adding soon:

* How to use Agentic AI in your day-to-day Product Manager career.
